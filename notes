make it as an abstraction like a library                => Done
lookup literature with "ipchandle" gpu workflows        => doing
shared memory(unified va) with this primitve            => Not supported, only supported for cudaMalloc
is uvm_driver sensitive to this primitve                => Should talk with Ishaan => Done

Qn. how to setup a workflow chain?
Qn. What about multi-gpu setup?

Meta data layer
    NF should first probe meta data and based on that it should access the data
synchronization
    Can use signals
intermediate results(later)


Design meta layer:
    offset
    locks for synchronization

Current week goals:
    setup dummy workflow of imag eprocessing or video processing using references
    lookup video to cartoon video workflow
    when the memory is to be shared across 2 vms with virtualized cuda api layer
    gpu direct(can write/copy data from gpu to nvme ssd disk), 
    properties of the memhandle memory(is it pinned or any ref count), what happens of free called on it => talk with utkarsh
