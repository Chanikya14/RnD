Deepstream:
==========
1. Capture video, Decode video using NVIDIA Video Codec SDK (NVDEC, NVENC)
2. pre-processing => resize, normalize, frame extraction, batching using cuda, opencv
3. use dl models(gpu backed) for object detection (GPU inference with TensorRT, DeepStream, or ONNX Runtime)
4. Feature Extraction & Embeddings
5. Action Recognition / Event Detection
    Use 3D CNNs, LSTMs, or Transformers for human action recognition
    Anomaly detection with autoencoders or self-supervised learning
6. postprocessing => drawing boxes
7. store

conditional, loops, one to many, => examples(real life or dummy)
goal: to built a platform which automates the building of pipeline using this primitive and should run that on any input 
        (user might provide a library(functions)/ kernels and some pipeline structure)
Issue: right now im embedding the code into kernels which is not desirable?!
